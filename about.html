        <h1 class="about-title">hi, i'm gabriela,</h1>
        
        <p>I'm a fourth-year architecture student at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
        
        <p>I've worked on student-led design teams, but also with professional industry partners as an intern, acting as a path to understanding how innovation can shape the environment.</p>
        
        <p>I ground my work in two guiding values: curiosity and community. Together, they drive the way I approach the boundaries of architecture.</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy seeking opportunities to question, expand, and connect design with its broader context.</p>

        <p class="about-thanks text-small">A heartfelt thank you to all the professors who have guided me through different approaches, each contributing to my growth and understanding of architecture. The journey has been both challenging and rewarding, transforming my perspective from the fundamentals to a more comprehensive design approach. Your patience and dedication have been invaluable in shaping the designer I am today.</p>
